Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique and a design pattern. which offers to replicate data between databases in real time.
Debezium is an open-source platform for CDC built on top of Apache Kafka. Its primary use is to record all row-level changes committed to each source database table in a transaction log. Each application listening to these events can perform needed actions based on incremental data changes. 
In this example, we are going to develop embedding the Debezium engine within our application for Oracle data base
